# CovNet
This repository contains the code required to design, train, and test neural networks to generate covariance matrices at different cosmologies.

## Getting Started 
1. Install CLASS-PT (https://github.com/Michalychforever/CLASS-PT) and follow the instillation instructions for the `classy` python extension there.
2. Download this repository to your location of choice
3. In the base directory, run `python -m pip install .`, which should install this repository as a package you can call anywhere on your machine.


## Using the Code
Users of the code should cite the authors (TODO: update with paper link), CovaPT (https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02914), and CLASS-PT (https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10607)
